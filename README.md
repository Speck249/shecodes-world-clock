## Project Description

The World Clock App is a user-friendly application that displays the current local time and date based on the user's location.

* **Intuitive User Interface**: Simple and clean design (inspired by SheCodes), making it easy to navigate between locations.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Time and date are updated every second to ensure accuracy.
